# ðŸ”Ž Proof Verification

Once you receive zk proof from your user, you can verify if they are correct using two methods:

1.  [**On-chain verification**:](onchain-verification.md) This method is useful for building a trustless application. The proof is verified on-chain, and the application can execute transactions based on the response from Reclaim Contract.

    A guide to on-chain verification can be found [here](onchain-verification.md).
2.  [**Off-chain verification**](off-chain-verification.md): This method is beneficial if you aim to build a centralised application. The proof is verified off-chain using Reclaim-SDK and the application can execute its business logic based on the correctness of the proof.

    A guide to off-chain proof verification can be found [here](off-chain-verification.md)
