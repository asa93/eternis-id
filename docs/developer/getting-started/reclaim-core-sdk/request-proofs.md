# ðŸ’« Request Proofs

### Define an endpoint for requesting proofs

Use `reclaim.requestProofs()` to request proofs from your user. The example below uses `CustomProvider`, you can learn more about `Providers` and how to use them to request proofs [here](../../../glossary/provider.md)

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
// index.js
// ...
app.get("/request-proofs", async(req, res) => {
const {userAddress} = req.body;
try {
    const request = reclaim.requestProofs({
        title: "Reclaim Protocol", // Name of your application
        baseCallbackUrl: "http://<YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_URL>/callback", 
        // callbackId: "<UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_GOES_HERE>" // optional
        contextMessage: "Airdrop for Reclaim Users!", //required : Why you are requesting this proof. Displayed on the user's device while creating the proof
        contextAddress: userAddress, //optional: your users' EVM/Solana/Bitcoin wallet address if you are planning to use this proof for NFT or Coin drops
        requestedProofs: [
            new reclaim.CustomProvider({
                provider: 'bybit-balance',
                payload: {}
            }),
        ],
    });

    const { callbackId } = request;
    const reclaimUrl = await request.getReclaimUrl();
    // Store the callback Id and Reclaim URL in your database
    // await db.put(callbackId, reclaimUrl, { userAddress: req.body.userAddress, param1 : req.body.param1 })
    res.json({ reclaimUrl }); // display this reclaimUrl as a QR code on laptop or as a link on mobile devices for users to initiate creating proofs
}
```
{% endcode %}

Show this `reclaimUrl` as a QR code or as a link to your users. It redirects your user to the Reclaim app to create and submit zk proof of data ownership.

### Where does the proof get submitted?

The proof generated by your user on the app gets uploaded to the `callbackUrl`

`callbackUrl = baseCallbackUrl + callbackId`

You can learn more about `callbackUrl` [here](../../../glossary/callbackurl.md)
